Picking the Best Reviewers
In general, you want to find the best reviewers you can who are capable of responding to your review within a reasonable period of time.

The best reviewer is the person who will be able to give you the most thorough and correct review for the piece of code you are writing. This usually means the owner(s) of the code, who may or may not be the people in the OWNERS file. Sometimes this means asking different people to review different parts of the CL.

If you find an ideal reviewer but they are not available, you should at least CC them on your change.
